## Overview
In today's world, the media is flooded with buzzwords, especially "AI" (Artificial Intelligence). Many people do not fully understand the underlying mechanisms behind the scenes, and consequently, they struggle to properly integrate AI into their applications. This workshop aims to introduce the fundamental aspects of AI, specifically machine learning, and explore their potential applications in the field of Robotics. Ultimately, this knowledge may help us achieve advancements in smart construction and building automation.

The workshop is divided into three parts:

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning**: This part introduces the basics of machine learning.
    - Types of machine learning
    - Machine learning libraries in Python
    - Machine learning algorithms and examples
2. **Introduction to Robotics**: This part introduces the basics of robotics and its applications. It covers the following topics:
    - Applications of robotics
    - Robotics libraries in Python
    - ROS (Robot Operating System)
3. **Machine Learning in Robotics**: This part combines the knowledge of machine learning and robotics to build a simple robot that can learn to navigate a maze. It covers the following topics:
    - Training robots using machine learning
    - Robotic Vision
